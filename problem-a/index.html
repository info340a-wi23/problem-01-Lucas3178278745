    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Kong_(2005_film)"> King Kong </a> is a fictional character who first appeared in a 1933 movie and is depicted as a giant gorilla. In the original film, king kong lives on a mysterious island that remained isolated from the rest of the world until a group led by a filmmaker discovered its presence. Kong fell in love with a woman in the boarding party, which eventually led to his capture. He was kidnapped to new york; he broke free himself but was shot down from the empire state building by airplanes.</p>
